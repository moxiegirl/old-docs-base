# upgrade

docker run --rm -it \

## Description

Upgrades UCP on a node. When upgrading UCP, you must run the `upgrade` command
against every server and node running Docker Engine in your cluster. You should
upgrade your controller and replica nodes first, followed by your compute nodes.  
Depending on the upgrade path for your version of UCP, you may also need to
upgrade Docker Engine. You can also choose to upgrade Docker Engine simply
because a new version is available.  Always upgrade a node`s Docker Engine
installation before upgrading its UCP installation.

After upgrading each node, confirm the node is present in the UCP console
before proceeding to the next node.
